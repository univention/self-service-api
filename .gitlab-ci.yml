# Access token requirements
#
# This pipeline needs some access tokens configured via the Gitlab UI.
#
# - `SOUVAP_HELM_ACCESS_TOKEN` - The token needs api access in its scope and is
#   used to publish the helm packages.
#
# - `SOUVAP_DOCKER_ACCESS_TOKEN` - The token needs container registry access
#   and is used to publish the container images.
