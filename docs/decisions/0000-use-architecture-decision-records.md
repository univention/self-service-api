## Context

The OPA integration of the Self Service API is starting as a PoC implementation
and intended to be evolved or replaced eventually with a production ready
implementation based on the insights from the PoC.

During the PoC phase we already make important decisions and especially
important trade-offs which we want to document for the future.

We made so far good experiences with ADRs in other repositories like the Univention Portal.

## Decision

We use lightweight Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to record relevant decisions and trade-offs.

## Consequences

Relevant decisions are captured in order and stay available for people who work
on this code-base in the future.

## Pointers

### Example ADR

The strucure of MADR 3.0.0 https://adr.github.io/madr/#example is used.
